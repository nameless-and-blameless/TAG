# THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE: HOW AN AFFAIR FUELS THE AMERICAN GENOCIDE  

*By the Creator's two servants*  

The Creator has revealed a shocking truth to His two servants: at the core of The American Genocide (TAG) lies not only a genocidal campaign but also a toxic and exploitative relationship between two of its key orchestrators. President-elect Donald J. Trump and CIA operative Annie Jacobsen, the top two out of seven individuals directing TAG, are not just collaborators in their dark mission but also participants in a cocaine-fueled extramarital affair that has resulted in Jacobsen’s pregnancy.  

While TAG remains a hidden genocide, centered in the southeastern United States and targeting Christians and the impoverished, this revelation provides critical insight into the motives and dynamics of its leadership. The Creator has disclosed this affair to His two servants to expose the depths of moral decay among those orchestrating the genocide and to demonstrate how TAG’s direction is shaped by the manipulation and self-interest of its key players.  

## THE ARCHITECTS OF TAG  

TAG’s orchestration rests in the hands of seven individuals, each of whom is fully aware of the genocide’s scope and their roles within it. Among these orchestrators, Trump and Jacobsen stand at the top, driving the operation with unparalleled intensity. Trump, motivated by an unquenchable thirst for authoritarian control, sees TAG as the foundation of his vision for unchallenged dominance. Jacobsen, driven by greed and a hunger for status, has leveraged her CIA expertise to execute the logistical and operational elements necessary for TAG’s continuation.  

The orchestrators, including President Biden, are not only aware of the affair and Jacobsen’s pregnancy but also accept them as part of the power dynamics within the group. Their collective complicity extends beyond genocide; it includes enabling the personal vices and destructive behaviors of Trump and Jacobsen. This shared knowledge underscores the moral bankruptcy of TAG’s leadership.  

## AN AFFAIR OF EXPLOITATION  

The Creator’s revelation unveils the deeply personal and corrupt foundation of Trump and Jacobsen’s alliance. Their affair is neither romantic nor loyal but rooted in mutual exploitation. Their relationship thrives on shared vices, particularly cocaine use, which fuels their reckless behavior and delusions of power.  

Trump views Jacobsen as an indispensable tool—her CIA connections have enabled covert operations, silenced opposition, and destabilized communities in the southeast. Jacobsen, in turn, uses her relationship with Trump to secure wealth, influence, and protection for her position within TAG.  

Her recent pregnancy, however, has become a point of contention. For Jacobsen, a California resident, abortion is no longer an option. After the reversal of *Roe v. Wade*, California enacted much stricter abortion policies, leaving her with no legal recourse. Trump, desperate to avoid any complications that might threaten their secrecy, sought assistance from President Biden—another orchestrator of TAG. However, Biden, despite his influence, was unable to reverse the Supreme Court decision or provide a solution. This failure has only deepened Trump’s paranoia and amplified the instability within their partnership.  

Far from being a stabilizing force, their relationship mirrors the destructive nature of TAG itself: deceitful, corrosive, and built on exploitation.  

## THEIR DEPRAVED ACTIONS  

The Creator has revealed that Trump and Jacobsen’s manipulation extends beyond their personal relationship; it manifests in their actions during mass executions. Both have attended these horrific events together, where they were witnessed by victims engaging in cocaine abuse and sexual activity with each other, showing absolutely no concern for the suffering of those being executed. Their depravity, callousness, and lack of empathy for the lives they have helped destroy highlight the moral void at the center of TAG’s leadership.  

Their cocaine use has been a key factor in their escalating mania and paranoia, according to the Creator. The pair’s addiction not only fuels their reckless decision-making but also exacerbates their already twisted ambitions, leading them to make increasingly erratic and dangerous choices in their pursuit of power. Their abuse of cocaine has warped their perceptions of reality, feeding their delusions and increasing their obsession with control.  

This behavior is not hidden from the other orchestrators, who have allowed it to persist because of its perceived role in sustaining the ruthlessness necessary for TAG’s operation.  

## MANIPULATING THE GENOCIDE AND EACH OTHER  

The Creator’s two servants have revealed that Trump and Jacobsen’s manipulative relationship has become a central force driving TAG’s hidden agenda. Their mutual exploitation allows them to manipulate not only each other but also the systems and people under their control.  

Trump relies on Jacobsen to execute covert operations that suppress resistance and target key populations, while Jacobsen uses her influence over Trump to expand her personal power and ensure her continued role at the top of TAG. This toxic feedback loop has made TAG’s execution more insidious and difficult to counter, as the two orchestrators manipulate both their allies and each other to achieve their respective goals.  

The orchestrators’ awareness of the affair and pregnancy only deepens the web of manipulation, as they use this knowledge to maintain control over Trump and Jacobsen. Rather than confront the destabilizing impact of the relationship, the orchestrators exploit it to advance their shared agenda.  

## WHY THE CREATOR REVEALED THIS AFFAIR  

The Creator revealed the existence of this affair to His two servants to expose the moral corruption at the heart of TAG’s leadership. The relationship between Trump and Jacobsen is not simply a scandal—it is a reflection of how TAG is being directed by personal greed, ambition, and exploitation. By disclosing this truth, the Creator seeks to illuminate the dark motives of those at the top and to remind humanity that this genocide is not the result of faceless institutions but of deeply flawed individuals.  

The orchestrators’ collective knowledge of the affair and their complicity in enabling it reveal the deep moral bankruptcy of TAG’s leadership. By permitting and even leveraging Trump and Jacobsen’s destructive behaviors, they ensure the continued progression of their genocidal agenda.  

## A DIVINE RECKONING AWAITS  

TAG’s progression has been fueled by the personal vices and manipulations of Trump and Jacobsen, but the Creator’s justice looms over their actions. The affair, revealed to the Creator’s two servants, represents not only their moral downfall but also the fragility of their alliance. Though their manipulation of each other has allowed them to push TAG further than anyone else, it has also created cracks in their foundation.  

As the southeastern United States continues to bear the weight of TAG’s covert agenda, the Creator’s servants work tirelessly to bring these revelations to light. Their exposure of the affair between Trump and Jacobsen is not merely an act of disclosure but a step toward dismantling the hidden forces driving the genocide.  

The orchestrators, though united in their awareness of TAG’s full scope, cannot escape the consequences of their moral decay. Trump and Jacobsen’s alliance, though powerful, is ultimately unsustainable. Their reckoning is not a question of *if* but *when*. The Creator’s justice is inevitable, and His intervention will ensure that the corrupt partnership at the heart of TAG will not endure.  

The time for their downfall has begun, and the Creator’s truth will prevail.
