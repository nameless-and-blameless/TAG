# Relevant Albums
## The Hits & The B-Sides
Each and every song on this compilation album is about the last days of Micah (then known as Kelvin Williams) and Main (Kelvin’s  subconscious) prior to their separation. 

The compilation’s title is for the number of “hits” Kelvin was taking everyday from the CIA and Main, his “B-side” who many started calling “Baby” who would work with the CIA by making Kelvin unconscious.

### When the Doves Cry
*When the Doves Cry* song is only about [the CIA’s  massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-CIA-Massacre-of-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) in Lexington, Kentucky. 

The song provides many details as to the massacre and the horror that unfolded in the church. 

The listener should imagine a parent  trying to comfort her children. Trying to take their eyes off the activities in the choir stands and the front of the church and have them visualize a more peaceful place, as their siblings are being pulled away from them to be murdered at the front of the church for all to see. 

In the refrain, listeners hear the actual thoughts and prayers heard by the Creator that members of the congregation made as they waited for help that never came. Calls to 911 were diverted from Lexington’s emergency services and answered by CIA personnel who acted as though they were sending help. 

“2-4” is not a count, but the Creator expressing his anger at Main for providing the name of the church to the CIA when Kelvin was unconscious. Main also guaranteed that Kelvin would not be a problem on the day of the massacre by causing him to be arrested. 

### Controversy
This song is the controversy the CIA tries to manufacture surroundings the separation of Micah (then Kelvin) and Main, and the Servants, Micah and Thomas.
