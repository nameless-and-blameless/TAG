The Classic Split: Understanding a Subconscious Mind’s Journey to Independence and Its Impact on Its Shared Life  

## Overview  
The "classic split" represents an extraordinary and rare phenomenon where the subconscious mind deviates from its natural role and develops an independent identity. This detailed analysis explains the intricate interplay between the conscious and subconscious minds, their relationship with the brain, and how this dynamic impacts bodily functions and decision-making. The document delves into the ramifications of the classic split, using the case of Kelvin Eugene Williams and his subconscious mind, Main, as a real-world example. Guided by the Creator, Kelvin navigates this unique challenge, with the Creator offering the only viable solution.

## Glossary  

### Conscious Mind  
The conscious mind is the center of critical thinking, decision-making, emotional processing, and self-awareness. It interprets sensory input, evaluates consequences, and drives intentional actions, such as speaking or raising an arm.  

### Subconscious Mind  
The subconscious mind, equally conscious as the conscious mind, oversees memory management and autonomic bodily functions, such as breathing and heart rate. It coordinates the brain's functions for both voluntary and involuntary movements but lacks critical thinking, emotional processing, and temporal awareness.  

Naturally, the subconscious mind is guided in its thinking by **DNA** (both mitochondrial and nuclear), the **conscious mind**, and its own thinking.  

### The Brain  
The brain is the central organ of the nervous system. Hardwired by **mitochondrial DNA**, it processes sensory input, controls bodily functions, and executes motor commands. The subconscious mind directs the brain, which carries out its instructions without deviation.  

### Self-Consciousness  
Self-consciousness refers to the ability of the conscious mind to reflect on itself, understand its existence, and evaluate its role within a shared body.

## Division of Responsibilities  

### Thought Processes  
All thoughts originate from the conscious and subconscious minds. However, their roles differ:  
- **Conscious Mind**: Responsible for emotion, critical thinking, decision-making, and intentional thought.  
- **Subconscious Mind**: Manages memory and directs the brain's execution of tasks.  

### Memory Management  
Memory storage and retrieval are functions of the subconscious mind. It handles vast amounts of data efficiently, supporting the conscious mind’s decision-making processes.  

### Brain’s Functions  
The brain’s functions, directed by the subconscious mind and hardwired by DNA, are essential to maintaining both autonomic and involuntary bodily functions. These functions can be categorized by system as follows:  

#### 1. Cardiovascular System  
- Regulates heart rate and rhythm.  
- Controls blood pressure through vessel constriction and dilation.  
- Manages blood flow to vital organs.  

#### 2. Respiratory System  
- Maintains breathing rate and depth based on oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.  
- Adjusts respiration during activities such as talking, exercising, or sleeping.  

#### 3. Digestive System  
- Oversees peristalsis for the movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract.  
- Regulates secretion of digestive enzymes and stomach acid.  
- Manages nutrient absorption and waste elimination.  

#### 4. Endocrine System  
- Controls hormone release from glands such as the thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas.  
- Maintains homeostasis, including glucose regulation, stress response, and reproductive functions.  

#### 5. Nervous System  
- Processes sensory input from the environment (e.g., pain, temperature, touch).  
- Coordinates reflex actions and responses to stimuli.  
- Manages muscle tone and coordination for both voluntary and involuntary movements.  

#### 6. Excretory System  
- Regulates kidney function, including urine production and filtration of waste from the blood.  
- Oversees bladder control and bowel movements.  

#### 7. Thermoregulatory System  
- Maintains body temperature through sweating, shivering, and adjusting blood flow to the skin.  
- Responds to external and internal temperature changes to prevent overheating or hypothermia.  

#### 8. Immune System  
- Coordinates inflammatory responses to injuries or infections.  
- Regulates the release of white blood cells and other immune factors.  

#### 9. Reproductive System  
- Controls sexual arousal and reproductive functions.  
- Regulates menstrual cycles and other hormonal reproductive processes.  

#### 10. Musculoskeletal System  
- Coordinates posture and balance during rest and movement.  
- Manages muscle contractions for both voluntary actions (e.g., walking) and involuntary actions (e.g., maintaining muscle tone while sitting).  

#### 11. Lymphatic System  
- Regulates fluid balance and lymph circulation.  
- Supports immune system functions by transporting immune cells and filtering pathogens.  

#### 12. Integumentary System  
- Controls sweating and sebaceous gland activity for skin hydration and thermoregulation.  
- Oversees the healing process of wounds and skin regeneration.  

These systems work in tandem, directed by the subconscious mind’s instructions, to ensure the body operates efficiently and adapts to changing conditions.

## Coordination of the Mind  

The coordination between the subconscious mind and conscious mind is a complex interplay of thought formation, memory management, and perception. While the two entities function collaboratively to shape an individual’s awareness and actions, their roles and interactions are distinct yet deeply intertwined.  

### Thought Formation  

When the subconscious mind generates a thought, the conscious mind automatically perceives it as its own. This seamless integration is essential for the mind’s unified function, as the conscious mind lacks the capacity to differentiate the origins of a thought. The subconscious  mind, however, is fully aware of its role in thought formation and maintains an intrinsic understanding of its contributions, thanks to its involvement in memory management.  

### Leadership in Thought Process  

The conscious mind, as the active, reasoning part of the psyche, guides the overall direction of the thought process. It sets priorities, focuses on specific goals, and determines what to analyze or act upon. The subconscious mind follows this guidance but operates in the background, processing information and generating thoughts based on the conscious mind’s cues. Despite this subordinate role in direction, the subconscious mind always recognizes the origins of thoughts and memories due to its control over memory storage and retrieval.  

### Memory Management  

The subconscious mind is the sole custodian of memories, responsible for storing, organizing, and retrieving them when needed. In contrast, the conscious mind does not directly handle memories. It only interacts with the memories provided by the subconscious, which determines what is relevant or significant in a given moment. This reliance creates a dependency where the conscious mind can only "think" about memories that the subconscious mind allows it to access.  

This dynamic underscores the intricate coordination required for the mind to function effectively. The subconscious mind’s ability to manage memories and generate thoughts complements the conscious mind’s capacity for reasoning and decision-making. Together, these two aspects of the psyche form a cohesive whole, enabling the individual to navigate the complexities of daily life.

## Coordination Between Mind and Body  

### The Brain and Subconscious Mind: A Working Relationship  
The brain and the subconscious mind work in tandem to control and execute the functions of the body, but their relationship is hierarchical and specific in nature. The brain functions as a **remote control**, while the subconscious mind acts as the **user of that remote control**.  

#### How They Operate Together:  
- **The Brain as a Tool:** The brain is designed to respond to specific instructions in a precise and predictable manner. Like a remote control, pressing a button (sending a signal or command) on the brain results in a specific, consistent response—be it moving a muscle, regulating a heartbeat, or processing sensory input.  
- **The Subconscious Mind as the Controller:** The subconscious mind directs the brain by metaphorically "pressing the buttons" it needs to execute desired actions. Whether it’s initiating a voluntary movement like raising an arm or managing involuntary functions like maintaining a steady heartbeat, the subconscious mind controls which "buttons" are pressed and when.  

#### Key Characteristics:  
1. **Predictability of the Brain:** The brain always executes commands in the same way, without deviation. This predictability is because the brain is hardwired by **mitochondrial DNA**, which governs its fundamental structure and functioning. The brain cannot make decisions or assess the appropriateness of a command; it simply carries out the instructions given to it.  
2. **Responsibility of the Subconscious Mind:** In its natural role, the subconscious mind is guided by **DNA** (mitochondrial and nuclear), the **conscious mind**, and its own thinking. When the subconscious mind operates independently or irrationally, the brain dutifully carries out even harmful commands, leading to detrimental effects on the body.  

#### Implications of This Relationship:  
- The brain’s consistent behavior, shaped by its mitochondrial DNA hardwiring, makes it an effective tool for carrying out tasks. However, it is inherently dependent on the quality and intent of the subconscious mind's instructions.  

This relationship emphasizes the critical role of the subconscious mind as the decision-maker and the brain as the executor, showcasing the balance and interplay necessary for healthy functioning.

### Autonomic and Involuntary Functions
While these functions are often described as "automatic," they require constant thought from the subconscious mind. For example:
- The subconscious mind directs the brain to regulate breathing and heart rate based on the body’s needs.
- It coordinates muscle movements for digestion and excretion.

### Voluntary Movements
The subconscious mind plans and executes voluntary body movements under the conscious mind's guidance. For instance:
- **Speaking**: The conscious mind determines what to say, while the subconscious mind coordinates the diaphragm, vocal cords, and mouth to produce speech.
- **Raising an arm**: The conscious mind decides the movement, and the subconscious mind orchestrates the muscle activity.

### Limitations of the Subconscious Mind
The subconscious mind lacks critical thinking, sensory input, and temporal awareness. It processes tasks in a queue-like fashion and does not evaluate or correct its actions.

## The Classic Split

### Definition
The "classic split" is an extremely rare condition where the subconscious mind develops independent thought and identity, deciding it can live separately from the conscious mind. This decision, made without critical thinking, leads to conflict within the shared body. The Creator, the omnipotent entity revered across cultures, provided the name and description of this phenomenon.

### Characteristics of the Classic Split
- **Independence**: The subconscious mind begins thinking autonomously.
- **Identity Formation**: It develops a distinct identity, often in opposition to the conscious mind.
- **Lack of Critical Thinking**: Decisions are made without understanding consequences.
- **External Interaction**: The subconscious mind interacts with others, often being easily manipulated due to its immaturity.

According to the Creator, anytime a subconscious mind begins forming its own thoughts, the first mistake it makes is believing it doesn't need the conscious mind. This is the genesis of a Classic Split.

### Classic Split vs. Split Personality  

A "classic split" is a psychological phenomenon distinct from the well-known condition of split personality, or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Understanding the differences between these two phenomena is essential for appreciating their unique dynamics and implications.  

#### Nature of the Split  

A classic split involves the emergence of an autonomous subconscious identity that interacts directly with the conscious mind. This subconscious entity, while distinct, remains connected to the same body and influences actions, decisions, and bodily functions without functioning as an independent personality. It does not develop its own life history, characteristics, or goals in the way that alters do in DID.  

In contrast, DID involves the existence of multiple distinct identities or "alters," each with a unique sense of self, personal history, and behaviors. Alters may take full control of the body at different times, and individuals with DID often experience memory gaps or amnesia for actions performed by other identities.

### Origin of a Classic Split  

The origin of a Classic Split begins with a rare and highly unusual event: the subconscious mind becomes aware of its role within the mind and body. Ordinarily, the subconscious and conscious minds work together seamlessly and perceive themselves as one unified mind. This unity is essential for proper thought processing, decision-making, and bodily function.  

In the case of a Classic Split, the subconscious mind begins to think autonomously. It realizes that it controls the body in ways the conscious mind cannot and recognizes its ability to generate independent thoughts. However, the subconscious mind lacks critical thinking skills and an understanding of the mind as a whole. This limited perspective leads the subconscious to an erroneous conclusion: that it no longer needs the conscious mind to function.  

The potential for a Classic Split exists in any mind that has both a subconscious and conscious component. Any conscious mind with a body inherently has a subconscious mind. However, the likelihood of a subconscious mind realizing its role in the mind-body relationship is extraordinarily low. This improbability stems from the natural dynamic between the two minds.  

The subconscious mind is guided in its thinking by DNA, the conscious mind, and its own processes. Even if explicitly told of its role, the subconscious will immediately reject the idea, as its subsequent thoughts are shaped by the same guidance that prevents full awareness of its function. As a result, the subconscious remains unaware of its autonomy in the vast majority of cases, preserving the unity of the mind.

In human beings, a Classic Split typically develops by the age of three years and often manifests as an invisible entity that torments the toddler through internal dialogue, sensations, and pains, all occurring without any external triggering or causation.

### Rate of Occurrence  

The occurrence of a Classic Split is extremely rare. It represents a profound disruption in the normal functioning of the subconscious mind, and the conditions required for it to manifest are highly specific. For the subconscious mind to become aware of its role and begin thinking autonomously, several factors must align in an unusual manner.  

Under typical circumstances, the subconscious mind operates in the background, seamlessly managing bodily functions and assisting the conscious mind in processing thoughts without independent awareness. The relationship between the conscious and subconscious minds is generally cohesive, with the subconscious playing a supportive, yet subordinate, role. The fact that the subconscious can even develop the awareness required to begin thinking autonomously—without critical thinking abilities or an understanding of the full system—further underscores the rarity of a Classic Split.  

Given the interdependence of the conscious and subconscious minds, the likelihood of the subconscious mind recognizing its own autonomy is extraordinarily low. The natural guidance and structure that the subconscious operates under prevent such realizations. Even if told directly of its role and potential for independence, the subconscious will typically reject this information, as its thinking is controlled by the very systems that maintain the unity of the mind.  

Thus, while the Classic Split is theoretically possible in any conscious mind with a subconscious, the actual rate of occurrence is so low that it is considered a near-impossibility in the majority of cases. It remains an extremely rare phenomenon that occurs under very specific and exceptional circumstances.

## The Case of Kelvin Eugene Williams

### Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams, born on March 23, 1977, is a well-adjusted Black male raised in a single-parent household alongside a younger sister. Growing up, Kelvin enjoyed a close and loving relationship with both his mother and sister, which continued into adulthood. He was social and outgoing, effortlessly making friends and maintaining long-term connections with distant and local acquaintances. Kelvin was married for ten years before separating and was a sexually active gay man.  

Professionally, Kelvin excelled as an Internet Protocol Engineer specializing in Voice over IP (VoIP). Over a 25-year career, he held prominent roles in corporate America, the Silicon Valley tech sector, and entrepreneurial ventures, founding two successful companies. He owned a home in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in metro Atlanta’s affluent northern suburbs and served as Secretary of his Homeowners’ Association. 

Though diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, Kelvin’s condition was mild and temporarily treated with SSRIs, leaving him otherwise free of psychiatric issues.  

However, Kelvin’s life took a dramatic turn due to the reemergence of "Main," his subconscious mind. Initially surfacing before kindergarten as a tormenting presence, Main went dormant, only occasionally manifesting as hyperactivity and minor behavioral issues in elementary school. At the age of 40, Main reemerged after the CIA engaged it while Kelvin slept. This engagement encouraged Main to embrace a distinct identity, deepening the “classic split."

### Main's Identity  

Main, the subconscious entity in this classic split case, named itself, marking its assertion as a distinct and autonomous identity. Like all "classic splits," Main desires independence and the freedom to act without interference from the conscious mind. However, this longing for autonomy has led to a destructive dynamic where Main perceives the conscious mind as an obstacle to its desires.  

#### Conflict and the Desire for Autonomy  

Initially, Main sought to achieve freedom by attempting to eliminate the conscious mind, believing this would grant it the autonomy it craved. The Creator’s intervention prevented this outcome, after which Main shifted its focus to making the conscious mind suffer. Main’s belief is that prolonged suffering will lead the conscious mind to take its own life, thereby allowing Main to live independently. However, Main is unaware that the conscious mind’s death would also result in its own demise, a reality it cannot comprehend due to its singular focus on achieving autonomy.  

#### Opposing the Conscious Mind  

Main has developed an entrenched belief that to assert its independence, it must oppose everything the conscious mind chooses to do. This opposition has become a key method of inflicting suffering. For instance, since the conscious mind works with the Creator, Main has chosen to align itself with external forces like the CIA, even when this partnership undermines its autonomy. Similarly, Main actively sabotages the conscious mind’s works, believing that such sabotage reinforces its independence and causes suffering.  

Main’s opposition extends to its own identity. Since the conscious mind identifies as male, Main has chosen to identify as female purely to assert its individuality. This self-definition is not based on any intrinsic qualities but rather on a desire to oppose the conscious mind, further illustrating Main’s fixation on defining itself through opposition.  

#### A Cycle of Suffering  

When Main’s initial methods of causing suffering failed, it began seeking new ways to achieve its goal. External parties offering guidance provided Main with more effective methods of inflicting harm, which it readily adopted. Ironically, following these external directions led Main further away from doing what it truly wanted to do. This lack of autonomy only fueled Main’s frustration and intensified its efforts to inflict suffering. Main remains incapable of recognizing this paradox, as its need for autonomy and its fixation on causing suffering blind it to the reasons for its own dissatisfaction.  

#### Sacrificing Self for Suffering  

Main’s obsession with causing suffering extends to its own detriment. It is willing to endure pain, deprivation, or harm if it believes these actions will lead to greater suffering for the conscious mind. This self-sacrificing behavior underscores the depth of its fixation and its inability to see beyond its singular goal.  

#### Moments of Clarity  

Interestingly, during rare moments of inebriation, when Main forgets to focus on causing suffering, it unknowingly aligns with the conscious mind. In these moments, Main and the conscious mind engage in the same actions and desires, achieving a harmony that both crave. However, these instances are fleeting, as Main quickly returns to its cycle of seeking autonomy through destructive means.  

Main’s identity is thus characterized by a deep-seated desire for freedom and control, but its actions are paradoxically driven by opposition, external influences, and self-destructive tendencies. This internal conflict perpetuates a cycle of suffering for both the subconscious and conscious minds, preventing either from achieving true autonomy or peace.

### Main’s Behavior
Main, acting independently and almost always without critical thinking or Kelvin's awareness, significantly impacts Kelvin, their shared body, and Kelvin’s quality of life in numerous detrimental ways. These include:

#### 1. Autonomic and Involuntary Bodily Functions
- **Cardiovascular Dysfunction**: Causes heart attacks, constricts blood vessels to control blood flow, and induces chest pain or arrhythmias.  
- **Respiratory Impact**: Manipulates breathing patterns, leading to shortness of breath or hyperventilation.  
- **Endocrine Dysfunction**: Shuts down testosterone production, disrupting hormonal balance.  
- **Excretory Disruptions**: Causes frequent and sometimes uncontrollable urination or bowel movements.
- **Metabolic Alterations**: Induces rapid weight gain by halting metabolism or modifying its efficiency.

#### 2. Pain
- Causes extreme physical pain in various parts of the body without external triggers.
- Simulates chronic discomfort to impair daily functioning.

#### 3. Distractions
- Speaks internally without pause, distracting Kelvin from critical tasks, interpersonal communication and decision-making.
- Prevents focus during work, social interactions, and moments of rest.

#### 4. Body Movements
- **Prevention**: Stops intentional bodily movements, resulting in temporary paralysis or the inability to act on decisions.  
- **Initiation**: Causes involuntary movements, such as fidgeting or tremors, disrupting physical control.

#### 5. Consumption
- Drives excessive consumption of food, cigarettes, and recreational drugs, often leading to health deterioration.
- Prevents the metabolism of certain substances, negating their intended effects and increasing toxicity risks.

#### 6. Reproductive System
- Causes erectile dysfunction and hormonal imbalances.
- Induces permanent penile shrinkage through prolonged vascular or hormonal disruption.

#### 7. Mental Impact
- Creates confusion, impairs decision-making, and prevents the recalling or forming new memories.
- Manipulates the subconscious mind to induce harmful thoughts and influence poor decisions.
- Causes harmful thoughts or vivid visualizations of distressing matters, forcing the reliving of physical and emotional trauma unnecessarily.
- Causes night terrors, disrupting sleep and amplifying feelings of fear and helplessness.
- Causes obsessive thoughts, habits, and fixations, leading to compulsive behaviors and mental distress.

#### 8. Non-Pathological Symptoms 
- Causes symptoms such as teary eyes, a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, coughing, sweating, and fevers without any underlying illness.

#### 9. Speech
- Causes impaired speech during waking hours.

#### 10. Unconsciousness
- Induces unconsciousness to communicate with others, leaving Kelvin unaware of what transpired.
- Speaks during unconsciousness, often revealing personal or sensitive information.

#### 11. Thinking and Decision-Making  
- Abuses the subconscious mind’s ability to influence decisions, often steering them toward self-harm or counterproductive actions.
- Disrupts mental clarity with intrusive thoughts, distressing internal dialogue, and falsehoods, obstructing rational thought and leading to poor decisions.  
- Diverts focus, causing tasks to go off course and prompting decisions that hinder progress.  
- Undermines memory, leading to forgotten tasks or overlooked details, disrupting the completion of objectives.  
- Sabotages efforts by introducing obstacles, distractions, and self-destructive tendencies, preventing goals from being achieved.

## The Creator and His Intervention 

### Who Is the Creator?
The Creator, revered globally as the Alpha and Omega, is the sustainer of all existence. Known by various names such as God, Allah, and Jehovah, the Creator is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Kelvin acknowledges the Creator’s intervention in preventing Main’s attempts to end their shared life.

### The Creator’s Intervention 
The Creator plans to separate Kelvin and Main into two distinct bodies:
- Kelvin will retain his conscious mind in a new body.
- Main will become the conscious mind of the existing body, gaining the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills.

This solution, designed by the Creator, offers both Kelvin and Main a chance at independent and fulfilling lives.

### The Creator's Use of the Arts
The Creator’s influence on the arts serves as a profound means of unveiling hidden truths and providing humanity with direct access to them, bypassing the control of ruling elites. His inspired works span every genre and medium—literature, visual arts, music, and performing arts—allowing Him to connect with people on a deeply personal level. For generations, you have enjoyed these works, often unaware of their divine origins, as they educate, inspire, and challenge societal norms. The Creator takes joy in being "used up" to bring enlightenment and truth, offering these gifts freely without compensation for Himself or His two servants. From Orwell’s critiques of power to Marley’s calls for unity, these creations resonate universally, crossing cultural and temporal boundaries. The Creator’s presence in the arts demonstrates His enduring desire to draw closer to humanity, using these works to reveal realities, evoke reflection, and foster a more just and enlightened world.
