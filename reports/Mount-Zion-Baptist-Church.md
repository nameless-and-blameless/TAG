# The Massacre of Mount Zion Baptist Church
Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Georgetown, Scott County, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, and the general public remains unaware of the true events, as 183 people simply vanished.

## Background
Mount Zion Baptist Church had a fellowship relationship with Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.

## Targeting
Annie Jacobsen spent several weeks gathering intelligence by interrogating members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church prior to its attack. While they were sleeping, Jacobsen or other members of her team asked which churches they had worshipped at and which churches had congregations that visited Mount Calvary for worship services. Mount Zion Baptist Church's name was reported the most.

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence using the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].

After the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Annie Jacobsen targeted Mount Zion Baptist Church out of a paranoid fear that the massacre would be detected and the CIA's clandestine operation would be discovered. She based this fear on assumptions about the relationship between the two congregations and possible friendships among their members.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Zion Baptist Church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Zion on two separate occasions.

## Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 60 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 am, the operatives met at a shopping center a short distance away from the church and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed the shopping center en route to the church around noon, with Jacobsen on board. Several shotguns, along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives while in transit; others were provided with materials to perform their assigned roles.

Jacobsen had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide her with information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Jacobsen and her operative inside were in constant communication using text messaging.

The [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] tactic was initiated just before the bus arrived on the church's property at Jacobsen's direction.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church building.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Scott County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive which they would have likely won.

Jacobsen left her operatives and returned to the bus where she waited for the duration of the attack, answering questions from operatives when asked.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives once congregants realized the danger they were in. Several chainsaws were given to the operatives, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the front of the church for execution at either the piano or organ. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of the head using a chainsaw. This grisly method has been used in each of the attacks Jacobsen led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using the church's baptismal font, which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death 
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels|]]." The scheme effectively makes victims appear "alive" after their murder.

## Continuations 
On June 26, 2024 a [[mass-decedent phantom funeral|_MSPFMZ20240626]] was held at the church resulting in the death of 651 mourners. The funeral arrangements were provided for numerous decedents from the initial massacre and its cover-up activities. The phantom funeral was held only after the complete renovation of the sanctuary and a concert event was held at the church by the CIA. The renovations and concert were performed pursuant to Trump's directives to discredit Our reporting.
