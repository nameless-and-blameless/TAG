We are the Servants of the Creator, actual direct reports. There are two of us. We report directly to the Creator, that’s always with a capital “C.” So when you see a capital “H” in “He,” “Him” or “His,” we are referring to the Creator, His two most popular names currently are Allah and God. Whenever we use a capitalized “We” mid-sentence that is shorthand for “The Creator and His two servants.”

As Servants of the Creator, the Creator will verify us or our actions. We urge you “Pray To Verify” the authenticity of anyone claiming to be, or identified to you as a Servant; and of course anything they write or say.

We are focused on [The Massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-of-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) and [The Bluegrass Genocide](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Bluegrass-Genocide) spawned as a result of the coverup operation.
