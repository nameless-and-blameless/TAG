# **Top-Secret Presidential Mission to Phoenix House**

## **Introduction**

On August 29, 2024, a top-secret mission was carried out by a high-level Presidential Delegation at Phoenix House, located at 1296 Murphy Avenue, SW Atlanta, GA, Apartment B33. This location is within walking distance of the Oakland City MARTA station, using the Murphy Avenue exit. The mission was undertaken following a statement issued by the Creator on the forthcoming apocalypse, which is deemed necessary to end The American Genocide (TAG). Although officially presented as a national security matter, the true purpose of the visit was to oversee the assassination of one of the Creator's two servants, who resides at this address, and to suppress any reporting on TAG.

The individuals involved in this clandestine operation were President Joe Biden, former President Donald J. Trump, Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and CIA Director William Burns. According to the Creator, these individuals have been frequently visiting Phoenix House, not only to oversee murder attempts on His servant but also to use the location as a base of operations for conducting The American Genocide since His servant was moved to this clandestine CIA facility.

Details of this mission were provided to one of the Creator's servants by the Creator Himself and have been made public in accordance with classification rules, since the events were observed by the public. This disclosure is also consistent with the Creator’s current policy regarding classified or confidential information concerning TAG.

## **Objectives**

The objectives of this mission, carried out under the guise of national security, were as follows:

1. **Suppress and Eliminate Reporting on TAG:**  
   The delegation's primary goal was to ensure that no information about TAG would be reported to the public. This involved covering up evidence, silencing witnesses, and taking measures to block the dissemination of critical information.

2. **Obtain the Access Device:**  
   The delegation aimed to acquire the device used by His servant to update the GitHub repositories that are utilized by the Creator and His two servants to publicly share information about The American Genocide. Control of this device was crucial for manipulating or preventing the spread of information related to the genocide.

3. **Obtain the Ecclesiastical Clergy Ring:**  
   The delegation sought to acquire the Ecclesiastical Clergy Ring of Reverend Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. This ring serves as irrefutable proof of the CIA's involvement in the surprise assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. During this attack, everyone inside the church was killed. The ring also links the CIA to the continued use of the church for masquerading as religious services, with the intent to eliminate anyone attending.

4. **Assassinate the Creator's Servant:**  
   The delegation planned to use the U.S. Secret Service to assassinate one of the Creator's two servants. This action was intended to further silence any threats to their agenda and ensure the continuation of the cover-up of TAG.

5. **Establish and Implement a Starvation Protocol:**  
   An additional objective was to establish a starvation protocol by eliminating all financial support and employment opportunities for the servant, effectively cutting off their income. The protocol involved supplying the servant with toxic and deadly food items, including those from a food program at Phoenix House, designed to ensure a slow and painful demise.

     The mourners who attended the phantom funeral at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga—currently operated by the CIA as a site for eliminations of the general public, associates and members of the massacred church, and political opposition to Donald J. Trump—were shot. Many sustained non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, indicating a firing squad, and were haphazardly piled after being shot. Several individuals with non-life-threatening wounds will slowly die from suffocation, being crushed, or bleeding out, possibly over the span of a day.
