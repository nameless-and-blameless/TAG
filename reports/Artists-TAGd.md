# Artist TAG'd

## Overview

This report documents artists confirmed killed or currently in harm's way due to their connection with one or both of His servants. These artists have been targeted for various reasons, including their music being used by the Creator to convey messages, their association with one or both of His servants, or their work being overheard or observed by the CIA during illegal surveillance operations and targeted due to Jacobsen's speed-induced paranoia. The list includes prominent figures across different genres and mediums, from legendary singers like Tina Turner and Madonna to iconic ensembles such as the cast of *The Color Purple*.

Artists listed under "In Harm’s Way" may or may not be actively targeted by the agency. However, they are included out of an abundance of caution to ensure the CIA is aware that their actions are indeed affecting these artists. This entry aims to highlight the dangerous intersection between art, divine influence, and covert governmental operations, offering a stark reminder of the risks faced by those whose creative works resonate with higher powers.

## The Persecution of Lyricists 

It's important to note that while contemporary lyricists may compose lyrics that seem prophetic or deeply inspired, often they themselves are unaware if their words are foretelling the future or coming directly from the Creator. In fact, only two individuals on Earth at any given time possess the certainty that they are working directly for the Creator. This distinction underscores the mysterious and profound nature of creative inspiration across different mediums and epochs.

Lyricists should not be persecuted for their works, as their creations often reflect personal expression, social commentary, and artistic interpretation. Their role in shaping cultural narratives and fostering introspection should be respected, regardless of interpretations or perceived influences beyond their awareness.
