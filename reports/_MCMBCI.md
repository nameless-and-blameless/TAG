# Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

## Overview
Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. is a masquerade church operating on the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky. This illegal occupation began shortly after a massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. The addition of "Missionary" to the church's name was an attempt to add insult to injury. Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of one of the Creator's two servants, which the CIA knew was about to start the Creator's Mission #23 on Earth for the Benefit of All Life. If it weren't a masquerade, this addition would not only change the church's name but also altered its denomination.

## Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams, a lifelong member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was deeply affected by the massacre. Upon viewing photos and videos posted on the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church’s Facebook page, he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.

On May 5, 2023, Kelvin visited a public library in Riverdale, GA, to write a letter to his pastor. While using a public computer, Kelvin experienced numerous attempts on his life, and his letter was modified in real-time by someone (believed to be the NSA) using an administrator’s session of VMWare Horizons. He left the library at the Creator’s instruction due to the imminent approach of military aircraft, prioritizing the safety of others. The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta’s Central Library, despite being surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts on his life.

## Baptisms
Following Kelvin Williams' demand letters to Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., where he voted to remove the pastor, associate pastors, and deacons, the CIA responded by attempting to make new members of their charade church through baptisms.

After writing letters demanding the removal of the impersonator, deacons, and associate pastors, Kelvin Williams noted that the CIA attempted to fabricate memberships to undermine his efforts. He emphasized that becoming a member required baptism in the church's baptismal, stating, "Anybody wanting to become a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church has to put their ass in the baptismal." This statement was made in frustration, as he did not expect the baptismal, which had been involved in criminal activity, to be cleaned out. However, the CIA did clean it and staged a baptism using a person who resembled his uncle, as shown in photos on their Facebook page. These photos also included supposed family members—specifically, siblings of Patricia Williams and their children—who rarely attended church. The CIA was aware of a familial connection between Kelvin Williams and Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, but did not realize that the connection stemmed from Kelvin’s father.

The 40th Pastoral Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., was announced in an unprecedented manner. Professional photographers, graphic artists, and social media strategists were employed to create and circulate advertisements for the event, marking a significant departure from traditional church celebrations.

### Controversies and Criticisms
The event was highly publicized, it was the first announced event for Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church since the church's 2023 formation after the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. Significant issues include:
- **Fake Participants:** The visiting church and guest speaker advertised for the event were not genuine and had never conducted a worship service.
- **Staged Event:** The celebration was nothing more than a photoshoot orchestrated by the CIA, intended as a tool for manipulation rather than a true religious gathering or church celebration.
- **Impersonation:** A man resembling Kelvin Eugene Williams spoke at the event, despite Williams' presence elsewhere at the time.

### Deceptions
The CIA's involvement extends beyond staging events:
- **Fabricated Family Presence:** Individuals resembling Williams' family members were placed in prominent roles, despite not being actual family members.
- **Staged Photos:** The church's events and impersonated family members were depicted in staged photographs, misleading viewers about their true involvement and identity.

### Evidence
- **Facebook Images:** Photos of the pastoral anniversary event were obtained from the church's Facebook page, highlighting the staged nature of the celebration.

### **Continuations of Violence**
Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. has been exploited by TAG perpetrators as a site for numerous [[phantom funerals|phantom funeral] and other community-oriented charitable and social events. These events have served as covert, continued acts of violence, targeting unsuspecting attendees.

#### **Lethal Consequences for Visitors**
Anyone attending or visiting the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church is systematically identified and eliminated. The church has become a focal point in TAG's operations, turning community outreach and memorials into traps aimed at eradicating those connected to previous victims or affiliated with the church in any way.

#### **Social Media Presence**
The masquerade church maintains a social media presence that portrays a facade of normalcy, using **actors and models** for staged photography. All individuals appearing in these photos should be considered endangered due to their association with the portrayal. The photographs are typically taken during the workweek to avoid arousing suspicion.

On **Sundays**, the property is staffed by **CIA operatives** who are tasked with eliminating anyone who comes onto the premises. This strategic timing ensures that no unwelcome visitors can disrupt their ongoing operation or expose their true activities.
