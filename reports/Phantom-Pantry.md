# Phantom and Feeder Pantries 

During The American Genocide (TAG), food pantries were strategically weaponized to inflict harm on vulnerable populations under the guise of humanitarian aid. Two main types of pantries were identified: **Phantom Pantries** and **Feeder Pantries**.

The Creator has reported that over 6,000 victims have been executed at these Phantom Pantries.

## Types of Food Pantries

### Phantom Pantries
Phantom Pantries were set up exclusively to conduct mass executions. No individual who sought assistance from these pantries left alive. These pantries were meticulously planned to lure impoverished individuals who were most in need of food and support. Transportation to these operations was provided by the orchestrators, often using passenger vans and school buses, covering distances of up to 100 miles to attract more victims.

### Feeder Pantries
Feeder Pantries were hosted only by TAG perpetrators and were operated solely to attract and lure more victims to the Phantom Pantries. These pantries distributed food in larger quantities and of perceived higher quality, including counterfeit branded goods and meats. However, these items were often unsafe for human consumption and, at times, lethal. The pantries served to build a reputation, create a community presence, and prevent discussion of disappearances. Transportation was never provided for these operations.

## Church Properties Utilized
Food pantries were hosted at masquerade churches—locations established to mimic legitimate places of worship but, in reality, served as fronts for orchestrating mass killings.

### Churches and Locations
| Church                           | Location            |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Hickory Valley Christian Church  | Chattanooga, TN     |
| Mount Zion Baptist Church        | Georgetown, KY      |

* **Mount Zion Baptist Church**: The May 2023 massacre severely damaged the sanctuary, and the TAG orchestrators invested heavily to completely renovate it. Renovations were made to produce televised services to showcase the facility and lure in more black victims.

## Transportation

Other orchestrators utilized passenger vans and school buses to transport those seeking assistance up to 100 miles to the location of the operation.

## Benefits Fraud by CIA

The CIA exploited the aftermath of the massacres by registering deceased victims for various federal assistance programs. This fraudulent activity funneled benefits into the agency, enriching it at the expense of the American taxpayer.

## Non-TAG Orchestrators

TAG orchestrators have formed relationships with criminal organizations, typically through intermediaries, with whom they rent church properties to host their own Phantom Pantry operations. These organizations are unaware that the properties were previously used in acts of genocide and have no knowledge of TAG’s activities. They are motivated primarily by financial gain and utilize these venues for criminal activities, assured by TAG orchestrators that they will be protected from law enforcement interference, including through tactics like the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic, which redirects 911 calls from victims.

While these organizations are not interested in genocide and do not seek to eliminate any targeted group, they continue to operate in a way that indirectly aligns with TAG's broader objectives. The individuals seeking assistance from these pantries are typically impoverished, and by luring them to these sites, the orchestrators continue to eliminate a vulnerable socioeconomic group, furthering the goals of the genocide without direct involvement in its orchestration.
